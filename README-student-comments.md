#Comments on my assignment

Hi,

this homework assignment was completed in 8-ish hours, not counting breaks. Some comments on my work:

Before beginning section 4, I managed to get all the texts working. But in adding lines of code for section 4 (some inside the functions made in section 2) some tests don't register properly. 
For example, the rest function works exactly like it did at the end of section 2 even though it now returns red. This is because I call the displayStats function (before the alert). If you would comment out this function call and rerun the tests, it should once again return green.

Secondly, if you click run tests, my game logic is (of course) all over the place since the tests call all kinds of functions.

I hope my work will be passable. Thanks for your time and have nice weekend!

Kind regards,

Marten Bonnema
